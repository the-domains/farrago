  Our next venture was to Gemma (2323 North Henderson, Ste. 109) One thing I
  love about our group is that most of us will try about anything. On our trip
  to Gemma, I had Crispy Veal Sweetbreads with whole grain mustard for an
  appetizer and braised Veal cheeks for the entree. Definitely a place to return
  to.
