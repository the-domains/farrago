description: 'Our next venture was to Gemma (2323 North Henderson, Ste. 109) One thing I love about our group is that most of us will try about anything. On our trip to Gemma, I had Crispy Veal Sweetbreads with whole grain mustard for an appetizer and braised Veal cheeks for the entree. Definitely a place to return to.'
