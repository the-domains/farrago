description: "One of the first places we visited and loved was Nona's (4115 Lomo Alto Dr.) Great Italian food. Except for a few standards, their menu changes regularly. Their pasta and pizza are exceptional. When the group went a year or so ago, I had Iberico Lardo on a crostini and a raviolo with an egg on top. Absolutely perfect."
